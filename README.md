Yo, Sheheryar, listen up, it’s time to get real,  
You’re flexin’ vegan, but meat’s your deal,  
Talkin’ plant-based but you’re grillin’ steaks,  
You’re a walking contradiction, man, that’s the breaks.

E-bike vibes, but you’re cruising in gas,  
Preachin’ eco love while you’re movin’ ass,  
You’re a wannabe green with your greenwashed scene,  
But your car’s a beast, ain’t nothin’ clean.

You rock the e-bike like it’s brand new gold,  
But your petrol ride’s the one that’s bold,  
Postin’ on the ‘Gram like you’re savin’ the day,  
But your emissions got us all in dismay.

E-bike vibes, but you’re cruising in gas,  
Preachin’ eco love while you’re movin’ ass,  
You’re a wannabe green with your greenwashed scene,  
But your car’s a beast, ain’t nothin’ clean.

Yeah, your vegan game’s a whole charade,  
In your fridge, it’s the meaty parade,  
Talkin’ ‘bout the Earth like you’re the chosen one,  
But your carbon footprint’s second to none.

So keep that e-bike, keep up the charade,  
But we see through your fake eco-grade,  
Sheheryar, man, you’re just a greenwashed flop,  
Step back, take a seat, time for you to stop.
